I try to create a social network. Let's see how far I can go.

## Installation
You need to create an images folder (in the clone) and download 

## accomplished
I'll write down here which parts of a social network are already in place (state of the repo) and download the background-image from ["This site"](https://pixabay.com/en/farbrausch-holi-solid-colors-142575/)
